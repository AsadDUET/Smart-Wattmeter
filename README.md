# Smart-Wattmeter
This is an University project. A smart prepaid energy meter which will masure kwh. If balance is over, this will cut the connection and sent Msg to the customer. It also protect for over voltage and current. if voltage or current is too high, This will alarm and wait for few munite and send text Msg. After that if if the power consumption is still high. it will cut off the line.
