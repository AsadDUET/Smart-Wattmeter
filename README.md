# Smart-Wattmeter
This is an University project. A smart wattmeter which will masure power. If the power is greater then the threshold. This will alarm and wait for few munite and send text Msg. After that if if the power consumption is still high. it will cut off the line.
# Component Needed
1. Arduino Board (uno/Mega/Nano/Mini)   1-ps
2. acs250 Hall effect current sensor    1-ps
3. Transformer 12V,3Amp                 1-ps
4. Transformer 12V,1Amp                 1-ps
